## Introduction

Tree Algorithms is a Java project that focuses on providing efficient and optimized solutions for working with trees. It offers a set of classes that implement various tree data structures and algorithms, including binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, heaps, and priority queues. These classes can be used as a foundation for tree-related tasks in a wide range of applications.

The project is designed to be easy to understand, well-documented, and flexible, allowing developers to incorporate tree functionalities seamlessly into their Java projects.

## Classes

The following classes are included in the TreesAlgorithms project:

1. `BinaryTree`: Represents a binary tree data structure and provides methods for tree construction, traversal, and manipulation.

2. `BinarySearchTree`: Extends the `BinaryTree` class and implements a binary search tree. It supports operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching in logarithmic time complexity.

3. `AVLTree`: Extends the `BinarySearchTree` class and implements an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains balance through rotation operations, ensuring efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.

4. `Heap`: An abstract class that provides the basic functionality for a heap data structure. It includes common methods for heap operations like insertion, deletion, and heapifying.

5. `MaxHeap`: Extends the `Heap` class and represents a maximum heap, where the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.

6. `MinHeap`: Extends the `Heap` class and represents a minimum heap, where the parent node is always less than or equal to its child nodes.

7. `PriorityQueue`: Extends the `MaxHeap` class and implements a priority queue data structure. It provides methods for enqueueing elements based on their priority, dequeuing the element with the highest priority, and retrieving the highest priority element without removal.

## Usage

To use the Tree Algorithms project in your Java application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Import the necessary classes into your project.

3. Use the classes according to your requirements. Refer to the documentation and examples provided within each class for guidance on using specific functionalities.

4. Compile and run your Java application, ensuring that the necessary dependencies are included.
